I'm using this to keep track of the (potentially temporary) design decisions I've been making.

These design decisions prioritize not deleting nodes. This is because it is easier to delete something then rewrite something.

1. If one user updates a node and the other deletes it, we keep the updated node.

2. If a node is moved by one user such that it keeps the same parent, and another user moves the node such that it has a different parent, the node will be moved to the new different parent.
