        If C(file), the file will NOT be created if it does not exist, see the M(copy)
        or M(template) module if you want that behavior.  If C(link), the symbolic
        link will be created or changed. Use C(hard) for hardlinks. If C(absent),
        directories will be recursively deleted, and files or symlinks will be unlinked.
        If C(touch) (new in 1.4), an empty file will be created if the c(path) does not
        exist, while an existing file or directory will receive updated file access and
        modification times (similar to the way `touch` works from the command line).
