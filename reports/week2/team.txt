This week's progress:
    - Chose a team name and created a git repository.
    - Reviewed Conflerge, a smart merge tool similar to what we will be working
      on.
    - Discussed our approach for the project proposal due Thursday.
    - Had some trouble creating a github repository because we didn't know that
      github doesn't store empty folders.
    - We are stuck knowing what exactly needs to be done next, since there
      isn't a ton of information on the class website and not much has been
      said in class yet about next steps.

Next week's goals:
    - Finish reviewing Conflerge. (everyone)
    - Set up weekly meeting times. (everyone)
    - Establish our week-by-week project schedule. (everyone)
    - Work on project proposal. Look at the pitches from the group members who
      pitched smart merge and compile them. Expand on vague points. (everyone)
