Last week’s goals:
    - Work on implementation so it can handle the more complicated cases present in the sampled repositories.
    - Work on ensuring correctness of evaluation scripts to ensure that the data collection isn’t causing messed up results.
    - Address feedback on report by possibly adding a definitions section and using a real world example. Also gather more results.
    - Give feedback to verigames via a code review

This week’s progress:
    - We gave feedback to the Verigames repository
    - Responded to feedback given by TA
    - Added an approach section that addressed our implementation of a generic AST
    - Looked at different ways to handle evaluation, a complete match to the developer’s merged resolution is not very realistic unless if it was a small fix. We are considering providing users with partial resolutions and counting the number of conflicts solved in each file. 
    - Extended testing to repository examples.

Next week’s goals:
    - Continue testing and debugging
    - Complete final draft of report
    - Respond to feedback given by TA and the presentation
    - Remove any lingering hypotheticals in the report and clean things up
    - Complete evaluation results/get scripts working on at least 8 repositories
    - Manually check unresolved conflicts to categorize them as false or true positives.

TA Meeting Agenda:
Go over given feedback, ask for suggestions/guidelines to consider for the final draft.
