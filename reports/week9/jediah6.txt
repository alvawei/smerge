Individual Status Report #7 (Week 9)

==================
Last Week's Goals:
==================

- ensure the python parser works with all testing files
- work with Alva and Steven on improving tree matching/diffing
- possibly add a second parser (should be easier after rewriting python parser, can reuse a lot of code)
    - still have to decide on the language


 - Finish implementing actions (need to be able to apply them to the base tree)
   - possibly try merging two sets of actions as well
 - Improve python parser functionality (parse python method parameters as their own nodes)
 - Help other teammates with tree diffing algorithm as needed
   - can't test actions without this
   - will probably have to make changes to generic AST
 - Begin working on second parser (may attempt java, time permitting)

================
Weekly Progress:
================

- fixed python parser
- began testing on more complicated files from github repos
  - found a lot of bugs, fixed a lot of them
- currently stuck on a few problems with merging actions
- changed how conflicts we can't solve are handled
- added a conflict counter for evaluation
  - not 100% correct
- reviewed verigame's repository
- worked on report


===========
Next Steps:
===========

- continue debugging and clean up messy code
