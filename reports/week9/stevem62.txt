CSE 403 Week 8 Individual Report
5/14/18

1) The coming week:
- Start to work on implementing the tree merger
- Make any report revisions

2) This week I helped with the Diffing process and reimplemented
some of our code in a different way to minimize the move actions
we identify. Our way of identifying moves was too general, so that
every time we moved a line, every line below it that was shifted
also was labeled as a move. Other than being very inefficient and
slow on large projects, it was very hard to debug. However, the
way we decided to implement it left us with some cases we could
not handle, so we decided to go with a different approach. Unfortunately
the changes I made did not stick with the project but that's the
way it goes. I also helped with revising the report.

3) This coming week I will continut to work on implementation,
trying to fine tune our action identifying and help with the matching
of nodes. We definitely need to make some big progress this week so
that we can deliver a fully working project by the deadline.
