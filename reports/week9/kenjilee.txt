CSE 403 Week 9 Individual Report
5/20/18

1.) For next week, I plan on helping out with preparing the presentation, taking the feedback left from
the last one into account. I will also get up to date on the implementation by looking at all the code
and asking questions to see what it does. This will enable us to all improve upon it. On top of this,
we will address the feedback by possibly adding a definitions section, since we've ran into that issue
very often.

2.) This week, I mainly looked at ways we can help improve our evaluation results. Specifically, the team
is thinking about changing the definition of success for our tool from having a complete match to the
developer's manual resolution to having a partial match. That is, the tool is able to solve some of the
conflicts on the file, but not all of them. Another thing I focused on was addressing the feedback given
last week and helping out with preparing with the presentation/report.

3.) For next week, the central goal is to get evaluation results that suggest our tool is working for its
purpose. Additionally, we have to analyze the unresolved conflicts and categorize them into true or false positives.
I will also focus on addressing the feedback and revising the report to get rid of any lingering hypotheticals.
Additionally, I will focus on editing the eval scripts to reflect our new definition of succcess.
