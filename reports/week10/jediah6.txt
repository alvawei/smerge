Individual Status Report #8 (Week 10)

==================
Last Week's Goals:
==================

- continue debugging and clean up messy code

================
Weekly Progress:
================

- Cleaned up a lot of the implementation and added lots of documentation
- Reworked the implementation to make debugging easier
    - We are no longer running into any errors while testing our tool, but the output is sometimes unexpected
- Worked with Steven on merging actions
- Corrected how conflicts are counted
- Rewrote parts of the report

===========
Next Steps:
===========

- Finish cleaning up code and adding documentation
- Find any final bugs if they exist and fix them
    - This requires heavy manual testing, as our only problems seem to be with the final output right now
