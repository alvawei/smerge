Last week’s goals:
	- Continue testing and debugging
	- Complete final draft of report
	- Respond to feedback given by TA and the presentation
	- Remove any lingering hypotheticals in the report and clean things up
 	- Complete evaluation results/get scripts working on at least 8 repositories
	- Manually check unresolved conflicts to categorize them as false or true positives.

This week’s progress:
	- Elaborated on the main addition of our tool: the Generic AST, also explained 
	the work needed by the user to use a different parser.
	- Changed evaluation process to make more sense. Basically, a positive means 
	the tool performed changes and a negative means it did not. True being the 
	intended case and false being unintended.
	- Gathered data for 7 python repositories. This included automatically generating
	a table of positives and negatives, and then manually categorizing them into 
	true and false.
	- Submitted final draft of report

Next week’s goals:
	- Start and finish presentation slides
	- Again, remove any lingering hypotheticals in the report
	- Address lingering presentation and TA feedback and submit final report

TA Meeting Agenda:
	- Clarify things that we will be graded on regarding the repository review on Friday.
	- Go over presentation feedback and ask for suggestions to make next week’s 
	presentation a success
