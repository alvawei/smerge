CSE 403 Week 8 Individual Report
5/28/18

1) This coming week I will continut to work on implementation,
trying to fine tune our action identifying and help with the matching
of nodes. We definitely need to make some big progress this week so
that we can deliver a fully working project by the deadline.

2) This week I continued working on implementation, helping clean
some up of the code for clarity, help with debugging, and to prepare
it for the code review. I continued working on the diffing. I added
a couple methods to help minimize the number of actions we detect so
that our tool would scale better and be easier to debug. For example,
if a local tree inserts an entire subtree, we don't need to know that
all of its children are also inserts, because they will not affect
the merging process. This means that the output will be smaller and
it will be easier to compare the trees. I also removed the action
"move" and replaced it with just insert/delete. This makes things
less complicated for us and keeps the design broken down into more
basic components.

3) This coming week I will continue to work on implementation. Our
main focus should be first to resolve any bugs and produce expected
behavior, and then to try to resolve more conflicts.
