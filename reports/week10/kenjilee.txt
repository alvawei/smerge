CSE 403 Week 10 Individual Report
5/28/18

1.) For next week, the central goal is to get evaluation results that suggest our tool is working for its
purpose. Additionally, we have to analyze the unresolved conflicts and categorize them into true or false positives.
I will also focus on addressing the feedback and revising the report to get rid of any lingering hypotheticals.
Additionally, I will focus on editing the eval scripts to reflect our new definition of succcess.

2.) So far, I've helped out with changing our evaluation process to make more sense. Before, we were emulating
Conflerge's evaluation process, which involved comparing to the user solution to merge conflicts. We found this
strategy very unrealistic, as we couldn't even reproduce their results following the instructions they gave.
To that end, we decided on looking at all conflicts presented in a file and categorizing them as either modified
or unresolved. This helps us narrow down whether they're a positive or a negative. From there, we categorize
them into true or false manually. I also helped by writing out the lessons learned section for our report, and
fixing any lingering grammatical errors.

3.) For this week, I plan to help revise the report by again incorporating all previous presentation and TA feedback.
I will also start working on the presentation for next week by making the slides.
