Last week’s goals:
- As always, address feedback given by TA (everyone)
- Finish basic implementation (parsing, diffing, merging, and unparsing two competing commits) 
so we can begin getting initial results.
  - Write a simple Python parser (Jediah)
  - Write a merger (Steven/Alva)
- Begin writing scripts to gather results and instructions on how to reproduce our results. 
These will follow a similar procedure to Conflerge as we found their assessment technique useful.
  - Evaluation of parser and merger (Kenji/Bryan)

This week’s progress:
- We addressed the feedback given, but it wasn’t up to standards, so we will fix that this week.
- Continued making progress on the implementation, getting the parsing and action scripts done
- Ran Conflerge’s scripts to analyze how they work and began writing basic code to emulate their 
experiments and appropriate them for our needs.

Next week’s goals:
-Get a working version of the tool up. It doesn’t have to have all of the desired features yet, 
just the main ones so we can get initial results in.
  -Finish basic implementation (parsing, diffing, merging, and unparsing two competing commits) 
  so we can begin getting initial results.
    -Write a simple Python parser (Jediah)
    -Write a merger (Steven/Alva)
-Continue writing scripts to gather results and instructions on how to reproduce our results. 
  -Evaluation of parser and merger (Kenji/Bryan)
-Address feedback on the report by detailing the implementation plan. We will do this by giving 
a running example and using diagrams to show how the diffing and merging algorithms work on that example.

TA Meeting Agenda:
-Discuss what parts of Professor Ernst’s feedback we missed. We felt like we addressed most of 
it (we went through it paragraph by paragraph fixing the parts he talked about)
