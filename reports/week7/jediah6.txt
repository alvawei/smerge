Individual Status Report #5 (Week 7)

==================
Last Week's Goals:
==================

- Continue working with GumTreeDiff

================
Weekly Progress:
================

- Determined that it will be too difficult to work around GumTreeDiff
- Finished "foundational" implementation of our python parser and generic AST
  - added basic junit test for ensuring the AST retains source code
- Rewrote parts of the architecture and implementation section in the report
- Started implementing actions (edit scripts) between trees for tree diffing


===========
Next Steps:
===========

 - Finish implementing actions (need to be able to apply them to the base tree)
   - possibly try merging two sets of actions as well
 - Improve python parser functionality (parse python method parameters as their own nodes)
 - Help other teammates with tree diffing algorithm as needed
   - can't test actions without this
   - will probably have to make changes to generic AST
 - Begin working on second parser (may attempt java, time permitting)
