CSE 403 Week 7 Individual Report
5/6/18

1.) For next week, I plan on revising the report to address TA feedback. I also plan on looking
at potential ways that we can gather repositories for our evaluation phase. This may include
writing scripts to get conflicting merges from the repos we listed. Additionally, I will research
how to classify a merge as a false positive or a true positive, since that is a grey area in our
report. For implementation, I will look at the output of gumtree and think of ways we can use it
to merge into a final tree that we give to the customer.

2.) So far, I have helped with addressing the feedback, but it was not up to the course standards
even though it felt like it was. Specifically, I added a section discussing explicitly what the
true and false positive and negatives are in our report. I also have been looking at Conflerge's
scripts for gathering repositories. We plan to use a very similar approach. I've also discarded
the idea of using Gumtree. Right now, I am just worried about making the deadline on Thursday.

3.) For next week, I plan on revising the report by adding several subsections that make our implementation
clearer. This includes having a running example to show how our parser will parse a given code file,
how the diff algorithm produces a diff, and how the merging algorithm will merge two diffs. In
addition to this, I will continue working on writing scripts for repository gathering/analyzing. I will
also be sure to write instructions on how to reproduce our results.
