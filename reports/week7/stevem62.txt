CSE 403 Week 7 Individual Report
5/7/18

1) This week I will:
- Contribute to team status report
- Contribute to Project 6
- Discuss implementation plan with teammates - we have a new game plan,
  we've decided the tools, so what is next?

2) This week, I've looked at the python parser script written by Jediah,
and figuring out how it works and what it will output so that I can handle
the tree merging implementation correctly and make it modular enough to support
multiple languages. There are a lot of design decisions, and I haven't gotten the
chance to start implementing, but I will do so this week.

3) The coming week:
  - Start to work on implementing the tree merger
  - Make any report revisions
