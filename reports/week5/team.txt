Last week’s goals:
    - Complete first version of the user manual
        - GUI usage (Kenji)
        - Examples (Steven)
        - Introduction (Alva)
        - Installation and Usage (Jediah and Bryan)
    - Add implementation plans to project report (everyone)
    - Further implementation, begin getting up to par with Conflerge’s
      implementation (everyone)

This week’s progress:
    - This week, we completed the user manual by each contributing our own
      parts.
    - We also addressed the TA feedback by adding an implementation plans
      section to our report. We also color coded our diagram for clarity
      purposes on how each component works together.
    - We’ve also worked on the github repository by getting basic parts done
      (deciding on which modules we need, setting up other tools, etc.).
    - Currently, we are stuck on trying to create an algorithm that handles
      merges better than Conflerge already does. We feel that Conflerge already
      exhausts what ASTs can do when it comes to merging, but we may be
      overlooking some things.

Goals for next week:
    - Continue on working towards getting results similar to Conflerge’s
      project without completely using their implementation. (everyone)
    - Begin adding/innovating a new algorithm that can handle merges better
      than Conflerge and other competing tools already do through full
      automation. (everyone)
    - Address both TA and Prof Ernst’s feedback. (everyone)
