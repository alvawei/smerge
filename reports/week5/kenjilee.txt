Week 5 Individual Status Report
4/22/18

1.) For this week, my goal is to help prepare the presentation by basically outlining our report
and deciding which details to add and which details to leave out. On top of that, we have to
revise our proposal again, so I will help contribute to that as well. Then, we have to start
the "user manual," but the link on the website is currently broken, so I'm not sure how to contribute
to that-- I will figure that out. On top of all of this, I am going to take an indepth look at
Conflerge's implementation to see how they organized their infrastructure so we can get a starting
point on the project's implementation. 

2.) As for this week's progress, I followed through with the user manual by formalizing the GUI
usage that a user may go through to use Smerge. I also refined it so that the features included
in it were less vague. This included listing what each of the buttons/functions do. However, I
feel like we may scrap this idea since there might be not enough time to complete it and there
are several existing tools similar to it. Another thing I helped with was addressing the TA
feedback. 

3.) For next week, I plan on working with my group to revamp our project to address Prof. Ernst's
feedback. His feedback was very insightful and will require very in depth changes to address.
Namely, I want to contribute by refining our evaluation plans to be more specific. I also will
contribute to our implementation, but I am not sure on which parts yet.
