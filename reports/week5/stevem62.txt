CSE 403 Week 5 Individual Report
4/23/18

1) For this week, I will prepare to present on Wednesday, and revise our 
proposal. We will have to look at conflerge's implementation in more detail
so that we can use that as a starting point to start writing code.

2) This week, I prepared for our presentation and presented it with Kenji.
I contributed to the team decision of scrapping the GUI idea. We need a more
concrete focus, so we decided on just building off conflerge and trying
to improve the diversity of merge conflicts it can resolve. I felt a bit
stuck trying to come to this conclusion at first, since we had committed
to the GUI pretty early on, but received feedback after the presentation
that it might not be a great idea. The TA let us know that the solution of
building off conflerge was enough.

3) This week, I help with the status report and discuss our requirements
with our team so we can complete project 5. One of our team members was
messing around with a tool called Gumtree, so I will look into that and
explore potential work we could do with that. He also tried putting
conflerge into our project to test it, and it didn't work, so if our team
wants to try to figure that out, I can help tackle the issue.
