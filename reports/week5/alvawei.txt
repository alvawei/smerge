Last week's goals:
    - Begin implementation.
    - Lay out class structure based on architecture. 

This week's progress:
    - Presented project on Wednesday.
    - We are having some issues with different expectations of our project from
      the TAs, Professor Ernst, and ourselves. Hopefully this is resolved in
      tomorrow's meeting.

Next week's goals:
    - We are struggling knowing how we are expected to proceed. Once this is
      resolved, move forward with implementation in earnest (since we are now)
      a little behind.
