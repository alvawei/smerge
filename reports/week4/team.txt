This week’s progress:

      We’ve also decided on using git merge for getting the input files.
    - Prepared a presentation on our project and presented it to the class.
    - We also completed the architecture and implementation plan, but we need
      to revise it a little bit.
    - We also drafted a mockup GUI that was a part of the architecture and
      implementation plan.

Goals for next week:
    - Complete first version of the user manual (README.md) (everyone)
