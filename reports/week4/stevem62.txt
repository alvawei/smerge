CSE 403 Week 3 Individual Report
4/16/18

1) This week, I will have to discuss the architecture and implementation
plans with my team members, and talk more about the GUI. If this is
something we plan to take on, I will need to look more about creating GUI's
in Java, and then start implementing.

2) This week, I helped work on the architecture and implementation part
of the project with my team. We had discussions about the role the GUI
would play in our project - finding a good balance between automation
and (simplified) user imput. In our report, I wrote about Javaparser and
discussed how it will help us by parsing code and turning it into ASTs so
that we can work with the files. I'm having trouble knowing where to start,
since this is a pretty big task and there isn't as much structure as any
of my previous classes.

3) For this week, I will prepare to present on Wednesday, and revise our
proposal. We will have to look at conflerge's implementation in more detail
so that we can use that as a starting point to start writing code.
