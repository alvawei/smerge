Individual Status Report #6 (Week 8)

==================
Last Week's Goals:
==================

 - Finish implementing actions (need to be able to apply them to the base tree)
   - possibly try merging two sets of actions as well
 - Improve python parser functionality (parse python method parameters as their own nodes)
 - Help other teammates with tree diffing algorithm as needed
   - can't test actions without this
   - will probably have to make changes to generic AST
 - Begin working on second parser (may attempt java, time permitting)

================
Weekly Progress:
================

- did most of the "first" implementation of our tool (parsing files into generic ASTs, merging tree diffs (actions), applying actions back to base tree)
- worked with Alva on the matching algorithm
- wasted too many hours trying to learn ANTLR to generate a new parser
- reworking current python parser to ensure it works on all python files we are testing on
- cleaned up a lot of the code and added more documentation so others can understand it better


===========
Next Steps:
===========

- ensure the python parser works with all testing files
- work with Alva and Steven on improving tree matching/diffing
- possibly add a second parser (should be easier after rewriting python parser, can reuse a lot of code)
    - still have to decide on the language
