CSE 403 Week 8 Individual Report
5/14/18

1) The coming week:
- Start to work on implementing the tree merger
- Make any report revisions

2) This week, I contributed to the Differ, making some code revisions and refactors
to identifying the different actions required for the merging process. I got stuck
for a while with my environment, because there was something messed up with my
IDE not being able to find my java_home variable. Eventually I figured it out,
but prevented me from doing as much work as I could have done.

3) The coming week:
- continue implementing the action identification (there are many different cases to cover)
- if time permitted, work on ordering actions, and move on to defining how to apply the actions
