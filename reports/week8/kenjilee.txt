CSE 403 Week 8 Individual Report
5/13/18

1.) For next week, I plan on revising the report to address TA feedback. I also plan on looking
at potential ways that we can gather repositories for our evaluation phase. This may include
writing scripts to get conflicting merges from the repos we listed. Additionally, I will research
how to classify a merge as a false positive or a true positive, since that is a grey area in our
report. For implementation, I will look at the output of gumtree and think of ways we can use it
to merge into a final tree that we give to the customer.

2.) So far, I've addressed most of the TA feedback. This included giving examples for better reading
and clarity, and also addressing minor in line comments. I also wrote up the instructions on how to
reproduce our results-- although I may have to make it clearer since the TA failed to reproduce them.
I also contributed to writing the scripts.

3.) For next week, I plan on helping out with preparing the presentation, taking the feedback left from
the last one into account. I will also get up to date on the implementation by looking at all the code
and asking questions to see what it does. This will enable us to all improve upon it. On top of this,
we will address the feedback by possibly adding a definitions section, since we've ran into that issue
very often.
