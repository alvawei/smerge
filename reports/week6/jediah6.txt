Individual Status Report #4 (Week 6)

==================
Last Week's Goals:
==================

- Get Conflerge working
- Find more conflict examples
- Further implementation
- Add junit tests

================
Weekly Progress:
================

- Couldn't get Conflerge to work on simple merge conflicts
- Rewrote most of the architecture and implementation plan in revised report
- Fixed installation instructions in the user manual
- Migrated the project to gradle and got Travis CI working with it
- Started working with GumTreeDiff
  - Succesfully obtained two tree diffs (a list of actions) between base->local and base->remote
  - Attempted to merge these diffs onto the base tree (seems to be a difficult task, but doable)
  - Began creating an unparser that converts GumTree's ASTs back into java source code (working on very simple files so far)

===========
Next Steps:
===========

- Continue working with GumTreeDiff
