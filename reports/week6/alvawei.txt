Last week's goals:
    - We are struggling knowing how we are expected to proceed. Once this is
      resolved, move forward with implementation in earnest (since we are now)
      a little behind.

This week's progress:
    - Met with Ernst on Tuesday, which clarified a lot of things.
    - Rewrote project proposal and user manual.

Next week's goals:
    - Really get into implementation. I wasn't able to spend a lot of time on
      the project last week, will try to make up for it this week.
