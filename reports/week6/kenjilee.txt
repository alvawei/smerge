CSE 403 Week 4 Individual Report
4/29/18

1.) For next week, I plan on working with my group to revamp our project to address Prof. Ernst's
feedback. His feedback was very insightful and will require very in depth changes to address.
Namely, I want to contribute by refining our evaluation plans to be more specific. I also will
contribute to our implementation, but I am not sure on which parts yet.

2.) So far, we've managed to hit most of the points we've wanted to on our revision. I helped
addressed the feedback given to us regarding the user manual. I also edited our evaluation plan
to match more closely to Conflerge's so we can compare our results with more ease. In doing so,
it helped our experiment count false and true positives and negatives. We've also made a big
step in deciding our implementation, as we will be using gumtree to take care of parsing
and diffing for us.

3.) For next week, I plan on revising the report to address TA feedback. I also plan on looking
at potential ways that we can gather repositories for our evaluation phase. This may include
writing scripts to get conflicting merges from the repos we listed. Additionally, I will research
how to classify a merge as a false positive or a true positive, since that is a grey area in our
report. For implementation, I will look at the output of gumtree and think of ways we can use it
to merge into a final tree that we give to the customer.
