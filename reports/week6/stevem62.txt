CSE 403 Week 6 Individual Report
4/30/18

1) This week, I help with the status report and discuss our requirements
with our team so we can complete project 5. One of our team members was
messing around with a tool called Gumtree, so I will look into that and
explore potential work we could do with that. He also tried putting
conflerge into our project to test it, and it didn't work, so if our team
wants to try to figure that out, I can help tackle the issue.

2) This last week we decided to go with some pretty big structural changes
to our project and change its direction. We're not focusing on the GUI as
a primary goal anymore, but rather just building a tool from scratch that
handles automatic merge conflicts better than Conflerge. Since so much
of the report revolved around the GUI, and taking user input for merges
that failed to be resolved automatically, we needed to basically rewrite
the report. I helped out with that by rewriting the motivation section,
and contributing to the implementation plan.

3) This week I will:
- Contribute to team status report
- Contribute to Project 6
- Discuss implementation plan with teammates - we have a new game plan,
  we've decided the tools, so what is next?
