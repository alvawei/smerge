CSE 403 Week 3 Individual Report
4/9/18

1) N/A

2) This week, I helped the team write the project proposal. My portion of
the work was focusing on writing up the "Approach" section. Since three out
of four of our group members had done their project 1 proposal on a git
merge tool, I gathered material from both tools and combined it into one.

I looked over the Conflerge project that professor Ernst pointed us to,
and ended up speaking to one of the contributors via email. I asked him
general questions about the project, and other questions such as asking
him what he would add next if he had 9 weeks to do so. He suggested the idea
of a GUI which could provide users with more of an interface for this merge
process, instead of succeeding silently or failing completely. We liked
this idea and I included the description of it in the project proposal.

3) This week, I will have to discuss the architecture and implementation
plans with my team members, and talk more about the GUI. If this is
something we plan to take on, I will need to look more about creating GUI's
in Java, and then start implementing.
