CSE 403 Week 3 Individual Report
4/8/2018

1.) Since this is the first individual report, I had made no individual goals last week.

2.) This week, I helped the team with the project proposal pdf. Specifically, I helped cover
the Current approaches section by adding examples of approaches that don't require much user
input to help illuminate their pitfalls. I also helped draft up the assessment and experiments
section by creating a general procedure and a graph that we could possibly record our results
in. Additionally, I helped out with general formatting so the paper looked organized. I also
made sure all of our references were cited.

3.) For the following week, I plan to gain a better grasp as to how to approach our program.
This will be vital in completing the architecture and implementation plan. That said, I will
be conducting even more research on current approaches that solve git merging issues. Currently,
I strongly believe that our approach to the issue must find the 'sweet spot' between automation
and user input. Having user input will allow the tool to generate the correct merges more often,
and if we can find a way to streamline the user input (via a GUI or something), then it will make
programmers' lives much easier. That said, I am still not entirely sure what algorithms we should
use for automating git merges, or how to define a 'successful merge', so I will research more on
that.
